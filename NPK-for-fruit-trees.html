                  If you’ve ever wondered why your fruit trees aren’t producing
                  as much fruit as expected—or why the fruit lacks sweetness,
                  size, or colour—the answer may lie in the nutrients you're
                  feeding them. More specifically, the balance of
                  <a

                <p class="leading-relaxed">
                  NPK stands for Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium
                  (K)—the three core macronutrients every plant needs. For fruit
                  trees, however, the right ratio of these nutrients isn’t just
                  important—it’s essential. Feed too much nitrogen, and you’ll
                  get lots of leafy growth but few flowers. Use too little
                  potassium, and your fruit may be small, pale, or lacking
                  flavour.

                <p class="leading-relaxed">
                  This is where a specialised fertiliser like
                  CompleteGrow’s Advanced NPK 4‑18‑38 + Calcium & Magnesium comes in.
                  Designed specifically for fruiting plants under Australian
                  growing conditions, it delivers a high-potassium punch with
                  balanced support for flowering and fruit development.

                  What Is NPK, and Why Does It Matter for Fruit Trees?
                </h2>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">Let’s break it down:</p>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>N – Nitrogen</strong>
                  <br />
                  Supports leaf, stem, and shoot growth. It’s essential for
                  photosynthesis, but too much nitrogen during the fruiting
                  phase can suppress flowering and delay ripening.
                </p>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>P – Phosphorus</strong>
                  <br />
                  Boosts root growth, flower development, and early fruit set.
                  It plays a key role in energy transfer within the plant.
                </p>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>K – Potassium</strong>
                  <br />
                  Regulates water movement, sugar production, and overall fruit
                  quality. It’s critical for sweetness, colour, size, and
                  firmness.
                </p>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">
                  When your fertiliser delivers the right NPK for fruit trees,
                  you’re not just growing a healthy plant—you’re growing better
                  fruit.
                </p>
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
                  The Best NPK Ratio for Fruit Trees: Low N, High P & K
                </h2>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">
                  Mature, fruiting trees don’t need excessive nitrogen. Instead,
                  they thrive with a lower-N, higher-P and K ratio.
                </p>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">
                  That’s exactly why CompleteGrow’s NPK 4-18-38 formula is so
                  effective:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                  <li>
                    <strong>4% Nitrogen</strong> – enough to maintain foliage
                    without encouraging unnecessary shoot growth.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>18% Phosphorus</strong> – ideal for flower and root
                    development.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>38% Potassium</strong> – maximises fruit
                    development, taste, and shelf life.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">
                  This ratio supports the tree’s natural growth cycle—from early
                  bloom to harvest—without overstimulating foliage or
                  sacrificing fruit quality.

                  Bonus Nutrients: Calcium & Magnesium
                </h2>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">
                  In addition to the ideal NPK blend, CompleteGrow’s formula
                  includes:
                </p>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Calcium</strong> – strengthens cell walls in fruit,
                  reducing cracking and improving firmness.
                </p>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Magnesium</strong> – aids in chlorophyll production
                  and nutrient uptake, keeping leaves green and energy
                  production high.
                </p>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">
                  These are critical secondary nutrients that are often
                  deficient in Australian soils, especially in sandy or highly
                  irrigated areas.

                  When and How to Use NPK Fertiliser for Fruit Trees
                </h2>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">
                  Correct timing and method are just as important as choosing
                  the right fertiliser. Here’s how to make the most of a
                  high-performing NPK formula:
                </p>
                <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4">
                  <li>
                    <strong>Seasonal Timing</strong>
                    <br />
                    Late Winter/Early Spring: Begin applying just before
                    flowering to support bud development.
                    <br />
                    Spring to Early Summer: Feed regularly to enhance fruit set
                    and early growth.
                    <br />
                    Mid to Late Summer: Support ripening, sweetness, and fruit
                    quality with continued potassium feeding.
                    <br />
                    Early Autumn: A final light feed helps the tree recover and
                    prepare for dormancy.
                    <br />
                    Avoid heavy nitrogen use in late summer or autumn—it can
                    promote new growth that’s vulnerable to frost or pests.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Application Guidelines</strong>
                    <br />
                    Always read and follow product instructions.
                    <br />
                    For liquid fertilisers like CompleteGrow’s formula, dilute
                    with water and apply around the drip line (not directly at
                    the trunk).
                    <br />
                    Apply to moist soil and water in thoroughly.

                    <strong>Frequency</strong>
                    <br />
                    Depending on the product strength and tree size, feeding
                    every 2–4 weeks during the growing season is ideal.
                    Consistent, moderate feeding is better than one heavy dose.

                  By feeding your trees with a fertiliser designed specifically

                  Final Thoughts: Precision Matters with NPK for Fruit Trees
                </h2>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">
                  If you want a thriving tree and a top-quality harvest,
                  general-purpose fertilisers won’t cut it. Fruit trees have
                  specific nutritional needs, and feeding them the right NPK for
                  fruit trees—with a low nitrogen, high phosphorus and potassium
                  ratio—is the foundation of good fruit production.
                </p>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">
                  With CompleteGrow’s Advanced NPK 4‑18‑38 + Calcium &
                  Magnesium, you’re not just feeding your trees—you’re setting
                  them up for success with nutrients that are balanced,
                  bioavailable, and tailored to fruiting.
                </p>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">
                  So whether you're a home gardener or managing a full orchard,
                  choosing the right NPK means healthier trees, better yields,
                  and sweeter, more flavourful fruit.
